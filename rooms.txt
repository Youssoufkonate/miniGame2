Beginning
You are standing at the end of a road before a dark and dank cave. The forest is covering the road lending a dark and
spooky aspect to the road. You hear a low wailing that seems to be coming from the cave.

Cavern
You enter a large cavern. You are surprised to find that the walls of the cave are glowing so you have no pproblem
seeing the large stalactites that have formed. To the south you hear the sound of rushing water. To the north you hear
strange sounds that sound like someone with a broken heart. You see as set of stairs at the west end of the cavern.
